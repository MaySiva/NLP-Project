Assessing LLM Susceptibility to Induced Doubt This research project aims to investigate the susceptibility of Language Models (LLMs) to induced doubt. The core idea is to explore whether repeated questioning and suggestions, such as ”think again” or ”are you sure,” can influence LLMs to change their initially correct responses.
