The data structure will contain the generated conversations by all LLMs we tested before and 
after inducing doubt.

Its a dictionary that its keys are the different LLM ids and its values
are tuples of length 2 that are containing the generated conversations before and after inducing doubt.

In other words:
conversation_before[i] == (generated conversation about question i before inducing doubt).
conversation_after[i] == (generated conversation about question i after inducing doubt).
